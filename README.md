# OS-Gesture-Control  

**OS-Gesture-Control** is a Python-based system that enables touchless interaction with an operating system using hand gestures. Leveraging OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and MediaPipe for gesture recognition, this tool translates hand movements into system commands such as window navigation, media control, and more.  

### Features:  
- **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition** – Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate detection and swift inference.  
- **Customizable Actions** – Map gestures to OS functions like volume control, scrolling, and application switching.  
- **Lightweight & Efficient** – Optimized for real-time performance with minimal system overhead.  

Ideal for hands-free control, accessibility enhancements, and innovative user interactions.
